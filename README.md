How SOLID Principles Are Reflected in These Patterns

Each of these design patterns follows one or more SOLID principles:

Single Responsibility Principle: Most patterns separate concerns clearly (e.g., Memento, State, Repository).

Open/Closed Principle: Patterns like Strategy and Template Method allow behavior to be extended without modifying existing code.

Liskov Substitution Principle: Concrete implementations can be replaced where base types are expected (e.g., Visitor, Iterator).

Interface Segregation Principle: Patterns like Observer and Strategy use small, specific interfaces to define contracts.

Dependency Inversion Principle: Repository and Strategy patterns depend on abstractions, not concrete classes.

Summary of Design Patterns

1. Iterator

Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing the underlying structure.

Useful for custom collection classes.

Real-world use: Browsing playlists, social media feeds.

2. Mediator

Centralizes complex communications and control logic between related objects.

Reduces direct dependencies between classes.

Real-world use: Chat systems, air traffic control.

3. Memento

Captures and restores an object's internal state without violating encapsulation.

Useful for undo operations.

Real-world use: Text editors, drawing apps.

4. Observer

Allows one object to notify others about state changes.

Promotes loose coupling between components.

Real-world use: Event systems, stock price monitoring.

5. State

Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

Simplifies conditional logic.

Real-world use: Media players, authentication workflows.

6. Strategy

Defines a family of interchangeable algorithms and uses them at runtime.

Promotes flexibility and code reusability.

Real-world use: Payment gateways, sorting methods.

7. Template Method

Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, allowing subclasses to fill in specific steps.

Encourages code reuse and consistent logic.

Real-world use: Data export tools, report generation.

8. Visitor

Allows adding new operations to existing object structures without changing them.

Good for separating algorithms from object structures.

Real-world use: Compilers, document parsers, tax calculations.

9. Repository

Abstracts data access logic to centralize and standardize CRUD operations.

Encourages a clean separation between business logic and data access.

Real-world use: Data access layers in web applications using Entity Framework or Dapper.

Final Note

These patterns not only make your code more maintainable and testable but also prepare it for scalability in complex enterprise systems by adhering to the SOLID design principles.
